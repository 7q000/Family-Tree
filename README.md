# Family-Tree
Storage and Documentation Template for people to compile, organize, &amp; consolidate their biological histories --> API?


    Assume we’ve ruled 23&me out for a myriad of reasons. Some of us have family members who carefully gather intel or mementos and serve as our family oracles. Some of us do not. Either way, don’t kill yourself making an effort to search for “ancestry” alternatives that seem more down to earth. Things you definitely won’t find, for instance, will be: 

    - anything with the utility of just helping you record what your relatives already know without false embellishment like jumping through weird hoops and feeling like you’re going down legally grey channels just by being on certain sites; or 
    
    - resources that might aid your personal research (the help of some more robust databases or specific search engines would be nice, even if they live behind a paywall, but I guess not). 
    
    They dont really exist on regular people parts of the internet, which is weird because it’s 2021. In the battle that is our search for belonging, let alone understanding who we really are, we often don’t have anything to properly reference our lineage but our loved ones. The impetus behind this project was to put a finer point to the knowledge I have on myself, at face value, in an attempt to ‘look inward’ by employing any technical skill that might aid that objective. The less glamorous version of that inspo is that I originally wanted to equip myself with this knowledge because intergenerational patterns and cycles are very meaningful to me, and I enjoy finding things I can point to when I ask myself why (they play a great role in my life), and I’m good with computers, and I know you’re curious too. Because this is something we all obviously share, my goal is to compile something helpful & free with utility to anyone who has internet access.  Gather what you know and record it, keep it amongst your own, and store it privately for whatever tomorrow brings. 

    This is a personal project, but I wanted to share it because it is so dear to me. I’m not making any money from it, or accepting donations, but I do want to connect with anyone who is interested and thinks they can meaningfully assist. I will make the resources (not my own history) for my own personal Biological History consolidation open source and public on GitHub when they are completed if anyone is interested. All contributors to the repo are welcome.
