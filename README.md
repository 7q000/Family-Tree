# Family-Tree, Web Scraper + Scraping Intro
Storage and Documentation Template for people to compile, organize, &amp; consolidate their biological histories --> API?


    Assume we’ve ruled 23&me out for a myriad of reasons. Some of us have family members who carefully gather intel or mementos and serve as our family oracles. Some of us do not. Either way, don’t kill yourself making an effort to search for “ancestry” alternatives that seem more down to earth. Things you definitely won’t find, for instance, will be: 

    - anything with the utility of just helping you record what your relatives already know without false embellishment like jumping through weird hoops and feeling like you’re going down legally grey channels just by being on certain sites; or 
    
    - resources that might aid your personal research (the help of some more robust databases or specific search engines would be nice, even if they live behind a paywall, but I guess not). 
    

This is an open sourced web scraping project.
